# Summary

The MATLAB plugin pattern is an implementation of a plugin pattern in MATLAB. This repository is meant to be used as a framework for projects where Research and Development is the main focus.
Although, Machine Learning is rapidly phasing out the classical algorithm development, there is still a intermediary step before, ML/AI is integrated into existing systems. This repository is meant to act as a experiment manager for classical algorithm development.
  
# Objectives

This repository attempts to :
- Reduce rework of algorithms
- Reduce unecessary branching
- Keep track of all experimental
- Keep track of experimental code
- Allow for integration with Digital Models
- Provide easy access to Distributed Computing Capabilities
- Provide MATLAB with an import structure that is uniform and concise

# Background
The following section describes vocabulary used with in the repository and the ideas that govern each object.

## Core Idea
`common.OpaqueBox` - This class defines the basic building block of the system.
`common.UtilEngine` - This class contains multiple `OpaqueBox` and runs them in sequence in it's list.
`common.UtilBox` - This class inherits both `OpaqueBox` and `UtilEngine` to act as a larger function block.

	class OpaqueBox{
	+List<string> inputvar
	+List<string> outputvar
	+run(struct) struct
	*apply(struct) struct
	#validate(struct) bool
	*debug(struct)
	}
	class UtilEngine{
	+List<OpaqueBox> action_items
	+apply(struct) struct
	+length() struct
	+box_replace(OpaqueBox) 
	}
	class UtilBox{
	#apply
	#validate
	#debug
	+generate_reqs List
	}
	UtilBox --|> OpaqueBox
	UtilBox --|> UtilEngine
	UtilEngine *-- OpaqueBox
