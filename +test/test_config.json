# The following configuration file is a test configuration and acts as a guide

    #
    # The import field designates a <key, value> such that the key becomes the
    # reference variables of the lib, and the value is the path to the lib.
    # This emulates the import pathlib as path structure.

    # The following function tree shows the order in which function blocks are
    # run within the application. The top-level function key designates the
    # function tree.
    #
    # The following tree shows the tree:
    #
    #   funct1 :
    #     - subfunct1
    #     - subfunct2 :
    #        - subfunct2a
    #        - subfunct2b
    #
    # While, it is possible to continually nest functions it is not recommended
    # as, it becomes hard to follow. In addition, a major redesign should be
    # considered if multiple layers of nesting is required.
